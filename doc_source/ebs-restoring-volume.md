# Replace a volume using a previous snapshot<a name="ebs-restoring-volume"></a>

Amazon EBS snapshots are the preferred backup tool on Amazon EC2 because of their speed, convenience, and cost\. When creating a volume from a snapshot, you recreate its state at a specific point in time with the data saved up to that specific point intact\. By attaching a volume created from a snapshot to an instance, you can duplicate data across Regions, create test environments, replace a damaged or corrupted production volume in its entirety, or retrieve specific files and directories and transfer them to another attached volume\. For more information, see [Amazon EBS snapshots](EBSSnapshots.md)\.

You can use one of the following procedure to replace an Amazon EBS volume with another volume created from a previous snapshot of that volume\. You must detach the current volume and then attach the new volume\.

**Note**  
Amazon EBS volumes can only be attached to instances in the same Availability Zone\.
