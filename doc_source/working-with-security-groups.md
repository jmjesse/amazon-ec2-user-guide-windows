# Work with security groups<a name="working-with-security-groups"></a>

You can assign a security group to an instance when you launch the instance\. When you add or remove rules, those changes are automatically applied to all instances to which you've assigned the security group\. For more information, see [Assign a security group to an instance](#assigning-security-group)\.

After you launch an instance, you can change its security groups\. For more information, see [Change an instance's security group](#changing-security-group)\.

You can create, view, update, and delete security groups and security group rules using the Amazon EC2 console and the command line tools\.

## Create a security group<a name="creating-security-group"></a>

Although you can use the default security group for your instances, you might want to create your own groups to reflect the different roles that instances play in your system\.

By default, new security groups start with only an outbound rule that allows all traffic to leave the instances\. You must add rules to enable any inbound traffic or to restrict the outbound traffic\.

A security group can be used only in the VPC for which it is created\.

------

## Copy a security group<a name="copy-security-group"></a>

You can create a new security group by creating a copy of an existing one\. When you copy a security group, the copy is created with the same inbound and outbound rules as the original security group\. If the original security group is in a VPC, the copy is created in the same VPC unless you specify a different one\.

The copy receives a new unique security group ID and you must give it a name\. You can also add a description\.

You can't copy a security group from one Region to another Region\.

You can create a copy of a security group using one of the following methods\.

## Add rules to a security group<a name="adding-security-group-rule"></a>

When you add a rule to a security group, the new rule is automatically applied to any instances that are associated with the security group\. There might be a short delay before the rule is applied\. For more information, see [Security group rules for different use cases](security-group-rules-reference.md) and [Security group rules](security-group-rules.md)\.

      + For custom TCP or UDP, you must enter the port range to allow\.
      + For custom ICMP, you must choose the ICMP type from **Protocol**, and, if applicable, the code from **Port range**\. For example, to allow ping commands, choose **Echo Request** from **Protocol**\.
      + For any other type, the protocol and port range are configured for you\.

   1. For **Source**, do one of the following to allow traffic\.
      + Choose **Custom** and then enter an IP address in CIDR notation, a CIDR block, another security group, or a prefix list\.
      + Choose **Anywhere** to allow all traffic for the specified protocol to reach your instance\. This option automatically adds the 0\.0\.0\.0/0 IPv4 CIDR block as the source\. If your security group is in a VPC that's enabled for IPv6, this option automatically adds a rule for the ::/0 IPv6 CIDR block\.
**Warning**  
If you choose **Anywhere**, you enable all IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to access your instance the specified protocol\. If you are adding rules for ports 22 \(SSH\) or 3389 \(RDP\), you should authorize only a specific IP address or range of addresses to access your instance\.
      + Choose **My IP** to allow inbound traffic from only your local computer's public IPv4 address\.

   1. For **Destination**, do one of the following\.
      + Choose **Custom** and then enter an IP address in CIDR notation, a CIDR block, another security group, or a prefix list for which to allow outbound traffic\.
      + Choose **Anywhere** to allow outbound traffic to all IP addresses\. This option automatically adds the 0\.0\.0\.0/0 IPv4 CIDR block as the destination\.

        If your security group is in a VPC that's enabled for IPv6, this option automatically adds a rule for the ::/0 IPv6 CIDR block\.
      + Choose **My IP** to allow outbound traffic only to your local computer's public IPv4 address\.

   1. \(Optional\) For **Description**, specify a brief description for the rule\.

1. Choose **Preview changes**, **Confirm**\.
